# hexabi

## Intro

This is a game I'm building, complete work in progress.

## Getting Started

### Initial set up
Standard set up

*git clone this repo*
*npm install*

### To run + dev
*npm start*

This will create the server and client bundles for you, then run the node server.
When changes are made it will automatically rebuild the server + re-run it. Or
automatically rebuild the client-bundle. No hot reloading - I hate it.

When you are done, kill the process, and the server will remain running.
*npm stop*
To finally kill it.
